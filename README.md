# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to perform Sentiment Analysis on tweets, classifying them as positive or negative. Using machine learning models, the project focuses on text classification, data preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualization.

## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become a crucial area of research, with sentiment analysis being one of its most popular applications. The ability to analyze opinions, sentiments, and topics at scale has transformed how businesses, researchers, and marketers make data-driven decisions.

Through this project, thousands of tweets can be analyzed within seconds to identify sentiments and themes, which would otherwise take hours to do manually. This project aims to illustrate a general approach to sentiment analysis by preprocessing raw tweets, exploring the processed data for insights, and then using machine learning to classify sentiments.

## Problem Overview

### Objective

The task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For simplicity, tweets containing racist or sexist sentiments are labeled as containing hate speech. The goal is to classify each tweet as either racist/sexist (label '1') or not (label '0') based on a given dataset of labeled tweets. 

The evaluation metric for this problem is the F1-Score.

## Preprocessing and Cleaning Tweets

Imagine trying to locate a specific document in a cluttered versus an organized office—clearly, a structured and organized space makes finding what you need easier. In text analysis, data preprocessing acts similarly by cleaning and structuring data for easier information extraction.

The raw text in tweets contains various forms of noise (e.g., punctuation, special characters, numbers) that do not contribute meaningfully to sentiment detection. Therefore, preprocessing is essential to eliminate irrelevant parts and retain text that conveys sentiment effectively.

Preprocessing steps include:
- Removing special characters, punctuation, and numbers
- Eliminating stop words that do not add significant meaning
- Converting text to lowercase for uniformity

A clean dataset will yield a feature set of higher quality, which is crucial for accurate machine learning model training.

## Exploring and Visualizing Tweet Data

Exploring and visualizing cleaned data helps provide insights into tweet sentiment trends and common patterns. Before delving into specific analyses, it’s helpful to frame questions like:
- Which words are most frequent across all tweets?
- What words are most common in negative vs. positive tweets?
- How often do hashtags appear in tweets?
- Are certain trends or hashtags associated more with positive or negative sentiments?

These explorations lay the foundation for effective feature engineering.

## Feature Extraction and Model Building

With preprocessed data, the next step is to represent text in a numerical format suitable for machine learning models. Techniques like Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF are common approaches for transforming text into vectors, capturing word frequency and significance within the dataset.

Once we have a feature set, machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines can be trained to predict tweet sentiments.

## Summary

This project demonstrates how to approach a sentiment analysis problem, from data preprocessing and exploration to feature extraction and model building. Sentiment analysis is a powerful NLP application that continues to influence business strategies, marketing insights, and social media monitoring.

This project covers the following:
1. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
2. Feature Engineering (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF)
3. Model Training and Evaluation using F1-Score
